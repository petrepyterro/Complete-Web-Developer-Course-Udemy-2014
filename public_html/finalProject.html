    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is the largest of the terestrial planets. Unlike the other planets 
      in the solar system that are names after classic deities the Earth's name come from the Anglo-Saxon word erda 
      wich means ground or soil. The Earth was formed approximately 4.54 billion years ago and is the only known 
      planet to support life.
